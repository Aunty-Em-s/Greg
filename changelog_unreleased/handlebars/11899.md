#### Support Glimmer's named blocks (#11899 by @duailibe)

Prettier already supported this feature, but it converted empty named blocks to self-closing, which is not supported by the Glimmer compiler.

See: [Glimmer's named blocks](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0460-yieldable-named-blocks.html).

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```hbs
// Input
<Component>
  <:named></:named>
</Component>

// Prettier stable
<Component>
  <:named />
</Component>

// Prettier main
<Component>
  <:named></:named>
</Component>
```
