#### Correctly identify which backslashes are removed by glimmer (#12302 by @MattTheNub)

This caused Prettier to unnecessarily add backslashes every time a file was formatted.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```hbs
{{! Input }}
<p>\</p>
<p>\\</p>
<p>\\\</p>

{{! Prettier stable }}
<p>\\</p>
<p>\\\</p>
<p>\\\\</p>

{{! Prettier main }}
<p>\</p>
<p>\\</p>
<p>\\\</p>
```
