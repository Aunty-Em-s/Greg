#### Concise formatting of number-only arrays (#10106 by @thorn0)

While in general, Prettier avoids this kind of formatting because it's not diff-friendly, in this special case we decided that the benefits outweigh the risks.

If at least one element has a trailing single-line (`// ...`) comment on the same line, the concise formatting isn't applied. On the other hand, single-line comments placed on separate lines don't have such an effect and – as well as empty lines – can be used for logical grouping.

// Input
