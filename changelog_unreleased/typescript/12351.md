#### Refactor printing definite assignment assertions (#12351 by @thorn0)

Also now definite assignment assertions are printed even when they aren't followed by type annotations, which is an error in TS but not a parse error.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
// Input
let a!;

// Prettier stable
let a;

// Prettier main
let a!;
```
