#### Print trailing commas for TS type parameters (#10109 by @sosukesuzuki)

Initially, Prettier printed trailing commas in TypeScript type parameters with `--trailing-comma=all`, but TypeScript did not support it at the time, so the feature was removed. However, it is supported now (since TypeScript 2.7 released in January 2018).

```ts
// Input
var bar: Bar<
  AAAAAAA,
  BBBBBBB,
  CCCCCCC,
  DDDDDDD,
  EEEEEEE,
  FFFFFFF,
  GGGGGGG,
  HHHHHHH
>;

// Prettier stable
var bar: Bar<
  AAAAAAA,
  BBBBBBB,
  CCCCCCC,
  DDDDDDD,
  EEEEEEE,
  FFFFFFF,
  GGGGGGG,
  HHHHHHH
>;

// Prettier main
var bar: Bar<
  AAAAAAA,
  BBBBBBB,
  CCCCCCC,
  DDDDDDD,
  EEEEEEE,
  FFFFFFF,
  GGGGGGG,
  HHHHHHH,
>;
