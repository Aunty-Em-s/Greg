#### Treat `.prettierrc` as `yaml` (#8105 by @fisker)

`.prettierrc` file can written in both JSON and YAML, previously we infer the parser to be `json`, if it's write in YAML, there will be a `SyntaxError` thrown when formatting it, now it's treat as a YAML file, but if it's write in JSON, it won't format as a normal YAML file, it will be formatted as JSON.
